# AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment

## Challenge Overview
This project addresses Challenge 2: AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment. The goal is to create a system that empowers users to build and interact with a document-based knowledge base using AI. Users can upload their own documents, ask questions in natural language, and receive answers generated by AI, along with feedback on the completeness of the answers and suggestions for further enrichment. The solution is designed for rapid prototyping, with a focus on usability, transparency, and extensibility.

### Core Concept
The system enables users to:
   * Upload multiple .txt documents to form a custom knowledge base.
   * Search the knowledge base using natural language queries.
   * Receive AI-generated answers that reference only the uploaded documents.
   * Flag answers that are incomplete or uncertain.
   * Get actionable suggestions to enrich the knowledge base, ensuring it evolves to better serve user needs.
This approach combines document management, semantic search, and AI-driven feedback to create a dynamic, user-driven knowledge environment.

### Core Requirements
- **Document Upload & Storage:** Users can upload any number of `.txt` documents. Uploaded files are stored locally on the server and are listed in the UI for easy management and deletion. This ensures users have full control over their knowledge base content.
- **Search:** Users interact with the system by asking questions in plain English. The backend leverages OpenAI to search and answer using only the content of the uploaded documents, ensuring responses are grounded in user-provided data.
- **Answer:** The AI generates answers strictly based on the uploaded documents. For transparency, answers may mention the source documents used, helping users trace the origin of information.
- **Completeness Check:** Each AI answer is analyzed for completeness and confidence. The system uses strict, rule-based criteriaâ€”such as answer length, presence of citations, coverage of relevant keywords, avoidance of redundancy, and detection of uncertainty phrases. A visual gauge communicates the confidence/completeness score to the user.
- **Enrichment Suggestion:** If an answer is incomplete or uncertain, the system provides actionable suggestions. These may include uploading additional documents, clarifying data, or addressing specific gaps identified through keyword and answer analysis.
  
## FullStack Features & UI
- **Intuitive Interface:** The frontend is built with React and Material-UI, offering a clean, modern look. Tabs separate document upload and search functionalities for clarity.
- **Document Management:** Users can upload, list, and delete documents. The UI is designed for ease of use, and drag-and-drop upload can be added for further polish.
- **Natural Language Search:** A search bar allows users to ask questions in plain language, making the system accessible to all.
- **Answer Display:** AI-generated answers are displayed clearly, with source citations mentioned in the text. Visual highlighting of citations can be added as a future enhancement.
- **Confidence/Completeness Gauge:** A visual gauge shows how complete or confident the answer is, based on backend scoring.
- **Enrichment Suggestions:** Actionable suggestions are presented to help users improve their knowledge base.
- **Responsive Layout:** The UI adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile screens.
- **Instant Feedback:** Answers, confidence scores, and enrichment suggestions update immediately after each search, providing a smooth user experience.

## Design Decisions
- **Frontend:** React and Material-UI were chosen for their rapid development capabilities, modularity, and responsive design. Components are organized for easy maintenance and future extension.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express powers the backend, with OpenAI providing semantic search and answer generation. Multer handles file uploads. All backend logic is contained in a single file (server.js) to maximize speed and simplicity during prototyping.
- **Document Handling:** Only `.txt` files are supported to keep the system simple and focused. Each document is treated as standalone; there are no supporting document relationships.
- **Confidence & Enrichment:** The system uses strict, rule-based scoring for answer completeness and confidence, ensuring explainability and transparency. Enrichment suggestions are generated based on answer analysis and question keywords.
- **No Database (Prototype):** Document metadata is stored in-memory for speed. For production, integrating SQLite or another database is recommended to improve persistence and scalability.

## Trade-offs Due to 24h Constraint
- **No Database:** In-memory storage was used to enable rapid prototyping, but this limits persistence and scalability.
- **Minimal Testing:** Automated tests and advanced error handling were omitted to focus on delivering core features within the time constraint.
- **Single-File Backend:** All backend logic resides in `server.js` for simplicity, sacrificing modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Basic NLP:** Keyword extraction and enrichment logic rely on regex and basic filtering, rather than advanced NLP libraries, to keep the system lightweight.
- **Limited File Types:** Only `.txt` files are supported for upload and search, streamlining development and reducing complexity.
- **Frontend Polish:** The UI is functional and clean, but advanced features such as drag-and-drop upload, multi-user support, and real-time updates are not included.
- **Source Citation Highlighting:** Citations are mentioned in answers for traceability, but are not visually highlighted in the UI. This can be added as a future enhancement.

## How to Run/Test the System

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm
- OpenAI API key (set in `.env` as `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Usage
- Upload `.txt` documents using the Upload tab.
- Search for answers using the search bar.
- View AI-generated answers, confidence scores, and enrichment suggestions.
- Click the logo to hard reload the app (Ctrl+Shift+R).

## Extending the System
- **Database Integration:** For persistence, add SQLite or another DB and update backend logic.
- **Advanced NLP:** Integrate libraries like spaCy or NLTK for better keyword extraction and enrichment.
- **Multi-user Support:** Add authentication and user-specific document management.
- **File Type Support:** Extend upload logic to support PDFs, Word docs, etc.
- **Source Highlighting:** Add visual highlighting for source citations in the answer display.
